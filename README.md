# INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Project! This project is a comprehensive case study focusing on understanding how Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, can increase its annual memberships by analyzing the usage patterns of casual riders and annual members. As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, this project involves exploring historical bike trip data to generate insights and develop data-driven recommendations to inform marketing strategies. The ultimate goal is to design effective marketing campaigns to convert casual riders into annual members, ensuring sustained growth and success for the company.

# BACKGROUND

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Certification course on Coursera, which I completed as a capstone project. The course provided a solid foundation in data analysis, covering various tools and techniques that were applied in this case study. The objective of the capstone project was to demonstrate the application of data analytics skills to solve real-world business problems. You can find more information about the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

## Data
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be accessed [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). This dataset includes the historical bike trip data for Cyclistic, which was used to analyze the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members.

The data used would cover rider information spanning a one-year period from January 2023 to December 2023. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. with [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) and is originally stored in separate CSV files organized by the different months of the year here.

### Data Limitations

The dataset contains some null values that were deleted and hence not used in the analysis.

## Scenario
I'm a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Business Task
1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?


# TOOLS USED

In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to manage, analyze, visualize, and share data effectively:

- **Excel**: Used for data cleaning and transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis. Additionally, Excel was used to visualize data through bar graphs, charts, and other visual aids.
- **SQL**: Used for detailed data analysis, enabling complex queries and data manipulation.
- **PostgreSQL**: Employed for database management, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of the bike trip data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Utilized for database management and executing SQL queries, providing an integrated development environment.
- **Git and GitHub**: Used for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and proper management of code versions.
