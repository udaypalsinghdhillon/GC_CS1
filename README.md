# BACKGROUND

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Certification course on Coursera, which I completed as a capstone project. The course provided a solid foundation in data analysis, covering various tools and techniques that were applied in this case study. The objective of the capstone project was to demonstrate the application of data analytics skills to solve real-world business problems. You can find more information about the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

## Data
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be accessed [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). This dataset includes the historical bike trip data for Cyclistic, which was used to analyze the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members.

The data used would cover rider information spanning a one-year period from January 2023 to December 2023. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. with [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) and is originally stored in separate CSV files organized by the different months of the year here.

### Data Limitations

The dataset contains some null values that were deleted and hence not used in the analysis.

## Scenario
I'm a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Business Task
1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?


# TOOLS USED

In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to manage, analyze, visualize, and share data effectively:

- **Excel**: Used for data cleaning and transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis. Additionally, Excel was used to visualize data through bar graphs, charts, and other visual aids.
- **SQL**: Used for detailed data analysis, enabling complex queries and data manipulation.
- **PostgreSQL**: Employed for database management, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of the bike trip data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Utilized for database management and executing SQL queries, providing an integrated development environment.
- **Git and GitHub**: Used for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and proper management of code versions.

# THE ANALYSIS

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the bike sharing data

## 1. SHARE OF RIDES FOR MEMBER AND CASUAL RIDERS
We can calculate the number and percentage of rides by the type of user.
```sql
SELECT 
    member_casual,
    COUNT(ride_id) AS no_of_trips
FROM 
    annual_data
GROUP BY
    member_casual
 ;
```
*Tablw showing the total number of rides booked by each type of user in the year 2023*
| Member Type   | Number of Rides |
|---------------|-------------|
| Casual        | 2047618     |
| Member        | 3626397     |

![alt text](assets/Q1.png)

#### Insights
From the data, it is evident that annual members constitute a larger share of the rides compared to casual riders. Specifically, annual members accounted for approximately 64% of the total rides, while casual riders accounted for the remaining 36%. This indicates that while casual riders form a significant portion of the user base, the majority of the usage comes from annual members.

## 2. What is the bike-type preference of member and casual riders?


Calculated the bike-type preference for:
- a) All trips booked in the year (2023)
- b) Members 
- c) Casual riders

```sql
--Share of each bike-type in all ride bookings

SELECT
    rideable_type,
    COUNT(ride_id) AS no_of_trips
FROM 
    annual_data
GROUP BY
    rideable_type
ORDER BY
    no_of_trips DESC;

-- Share of each bike-type in all member bookings

SELECT
    rideable_type,
    COUNT(ride_id) AS no_of_trips_members
FROM 
    annual_data
WHERE
    member_casual = 'member'
GROUP BY
    rideable_type;

-- Share of each bike-type in all non-member(casual) bookings

SELECT
    rideable_type,
    COUNT(ride_id) AS no_of_trips_casual
FROM 
    annual_data
WHERE
    member_casual = 'casual'
GROUP BY
    rideable_type;
```

####  a) All trips in the year (2023)
| Bike Type    | Number of Trips |
|--------------|-----------------|

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis of Cyclistic's bike-share data, here are the key strategic recommendations to increase annual memberships and optimize the marketing strategy:

### 1. **Leverage Peak Usage Months and Days**

- **Promote Memberships During Peak Months:** Focus marketing efforts on the months of July and August, which have the highest usage for both casual and member riders. Offer special membership promotions during these peak months to convert casual riders.
- **Weekend Promotions:** Target casual riders with weekend-specific promotions, as data shows higher usage by casual riders on Saturdays and Sundays. Highlight the benefits of membership for weekend activities.

### 2. **Focus on Popular Bike Types**

- **Electric Bikes Promotion:** Given that electric bikes are popular among both casual riders (53% of rides) and members (50% of rides), promote the convenience and benefits of electric bikes in membership plans.
- **Classic Bikes Incentives:** Offer incentives for using classic bikes, which are also widely used, to balance the demand and ensure availability of electric bikes.

### 3. **Optimize Station Locations**

- **Busiest Stations for Casual Riders:** Enhance facilities and bike availability at the top stations for casual riders, such as Streeter Dr & Grand Ave and DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St. Consider placing promotional materials and membership sign-up kiosks at these locations.

### 4. **Time-Based Promotions**

- **Peak Hour Offers:** With members having slightly more rides during peak hours (07:00-10:00 and 16:00-20:00), consider offering peak hour incentives or discounts for memberships.
- **Non-Peak Hour Engagement:** Casual riders prefer non-peak hours. Develop marketing campaigns that highlight off-peak hour benefits of memberships, such as flexibility and availability.

### 5. **Highlight Longer Average Trip Durations**

- **Casual Riders Trip Duration:** Since casual riders have longer average trip durations (21.23 mins) compared to members (12.09 mins), create marketing messages that emphasize unlimited ride time benefits for members, appealing to casual riders who enjoy longer trips.
- **Seasonal Trip Duration Trends:** Capitalize on the increased trip durations during summer months by promoting long-ride benefits in membership plans.

### 6. **Day-Specific Marketing**

- **Weekday vs Weekend Usage:** Tailor marketing strategies based on the distinct usage patterns. Promote weekday commuting benefits to casual riders, while emphasizing weekend leisure and recreational benefits to convert weekend casual riders to members.

### 7. **Enhanced User Experience**

- **Upgrade and Maintain Popular Bike Types:** Focus on maintaining and upgrading the fleet, especially electric bikes, which are highly favored by both user types.
- **Improve Availability at Key Stations:** Ensure high bike availability at stations with the highest traffic to improve user satisfaction and encourage membership sign-ups.

By implementing these recommendations, Cyclistic can effectively target casual riders, highlighting the specific benefits and conveniences of becoming an annual member, thus driving membership growth.
